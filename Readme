                                    JUSTCLEAN SAMPLE APP

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


APPROACH :-

    I have used Pure MVP Model Approach throughout the application. This structure makes the application

    so robust that it keeps the data and data manupulation part totally seprated from the user interface

    section.

    Presenter is fully responsible for all the interations between data eitheir comming from server , or

    DataBase or AppPrefrences and gives to the viewer.

    This App works in both online and offline mode.


Major Libraries :-

    I have used very useful libraries which are mainly used by very huge companied like twitter, facebbok,

    or Netflix.

    for eg:-

    -I have used RxJava to overcome expensive method calls and to fasten the performance for the application.

    not only this it has huge advantages.

    -Dagger2 by google is a dependency injection librabry which is also very useful.

    -Butter Knife to rid of findviewbyid method call everytime.

    -Green Dao ORM is for database to make life easy and fast

BaseUrl config is done as per the standards using defalut class BuildConfig in Gradle.
